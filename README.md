# Intro CS Paint Application

This repository contains a basic paint application created as an assignment for an Introduction to Computer Science course at Ariel university.

## Description

The paint application allows users to draw and create simple artworks using basic tools and features. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and a basic understanding of graphical user interfaces.

## Features

- **Drawing Tools**: Select from various drawing tools such as a brush, eraser, and shapes.
- **Color Selection**: Choose different colors to draw with.
- **Canvas**: A blank canvas where users can create their artwork.
- **Save/Load**: Save your artwork to a file and load it back into the application.

## Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Select a drawing tool from the toolbar.
3. Choose a color from the color palette.
4. Start drawing on the canvas.
5. Use the save button to save your artwork or the load button to open a saved file.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This project also demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as:

- **Encapsulation**: Grouping related variables and functions that operate on them into objects.
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Designing objects to share behaviors and to be able to override shared behaviors with specific ones.
